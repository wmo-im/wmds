1-01,Observed variable – measurand,"Variable intended to be measured, observed or derived, including the biogeophysical context","(ISO 19156:2011) NOTE 1:
In conventional measurement theory the term “measurement” is used. However, a distinction between measurement and category-observation has been adopted in more recent work, so the term “observation” is used for the general concept. “Measurement” may be reserved for cases where the result is a numeric quantity.
NOTE 2: The biogeophysical context is expressed in terms of domain, subdomain/matrix, and layer, and variables are organized hierarchically using these dimensions. Relevant domains, matrices and layers include atmosphere, aerosol, lake, river, ocean, soil, cloud water, aerosol particulate phase, land surface, troposphere, upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, space, etc.
EXAMPLES: (a)	In hydrology, this would typically be stage or discharge; (b)	Present weather; (c)	Air temperature near the surface; (d)	CO2 mixing ratio in the atmosphere.
