	rdfs:label "Spectral radiance" ;
	skos:notation "12253" ;
	dct:description "The radiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. It is a directional quantity. Note: 'spectral radiance' is also used for measurements by radiometers and spectrometers, where it means the spectral radiance incident on the instrument integrated over the normalised spectral response function of the instrument. Historically, spectral radiance was called spectral intensity."@en	.
