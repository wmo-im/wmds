	dct:description "Computation of stream discharge based on a relation between stream index velocity and average velocity (index-velocity rating) and a relation between stage and cross-sectional area (stage-area rating). Given these ratings and concurrent observations of stream index velocity and stage, average velocity and area are computed and finally discharge as their product.
