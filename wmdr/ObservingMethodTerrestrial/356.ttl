	dct:description "Recording gauge operating on the principle that static pressure at a fixed point in the stream is directly proportional to the head of liquid above the point, i.e. the water level is proportional to the pressure difference between a fixed spot in the water column and the atmospheric pressure. [Based on 'Recording gauges' in Guide to Hydrological Practices (WMO-No. 168), Volume I. 2008 edition, updated in 2020.]"@en	.
