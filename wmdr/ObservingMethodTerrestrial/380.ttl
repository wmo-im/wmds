	dct:description "Radar velocimetry or surface velocity radar (radar sensor) is an active remote sensing method which measures the surface velocity of moving water.  The radar sensor transmits microwave energy of a known frequency at an incidence angle (from nadir) to the water surface, where small-scale surface features such as waves shift the frequency of the microwave energy that is returned to the sensor. The frequency shift is used to compute the surface velocity of the water using the Doppler effect. Note: Because radar sensors measure the velocity at the water surface a transfer function, such as the probability concept, is needed to translate the surface velocity to a mean channel velocity [Based on Chiu, Entropy and probability concepts in hydraulics: J.
