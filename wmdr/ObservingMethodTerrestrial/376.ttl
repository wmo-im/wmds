	dct:description "Determination of water velocity based on the principle that a conductor (water) moving through a magnetic field will produce an electrical current directly proportional to the speed of movement (Faradayâ€™s law). By measuring this current and the resultant distortion in the magnetic field the instrument can be calibrated to determine point velocities of flowing water.
