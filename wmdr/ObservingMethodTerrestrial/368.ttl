	dct:description "An instrument that uses an acoustic doppler transducer to measure water velocity, depth and vessel path simultaneously and at various depths to compute discharge. The total discharge is computed from the profile information using matrix multiplication. [Based on 'Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers' in Guide to Hydrological Practices (WMO-No. 168), Volume I. 2008 edition, updated in 2020.]"@en	.
