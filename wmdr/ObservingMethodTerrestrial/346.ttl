	dct:description "Measurement of soil capacitance by means of radio frequency waves. The soil acts as the dielectric completing a capacitance circuit, which is part of a feedback loop of a high-frequency transistor oscillator. [Based on 'Frequency domain reflectometry' in Guide to Hydrological Practices (WMO-No. 168), Volume I. 2008 edition, updated in 2020.]"@en	.
