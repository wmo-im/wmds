aeronauticalMeteorology,,,Aeronautical meteorology,"Aeronautical meteorology covers worldwide, reliable provision of high quality, timely and cost-effective meteorological services to aviation users."
agriculturalMeteorology,,,Agricultural meteorology,Agricultural Meteorology relates to specific weather and climate services addressed to the agricultural community to help develop sustainable agricultural production systems. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-Agriculture.pdf
atmosphericCompositionForecasting,,,Atmospheric composition forecasting,Applications from global to regional scales (with horizontal resolutions similar to global NWP (~10 km and coarser) with stringent timeliness requirements (NRT) to support operations such as sand and dust storm and chemical weather forecasts [source: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/documents/FINAL_GAW_221.pdf]
atmosphericCompositionMonitoring,,,Atmospheric composition monitoring and analysis,"Applications related to evaluating and analysing changes (temporally and spatially) in atmospheric composition regionally and globally to support treaty monitoring, climatologies and re-analyses, assessing trends in composition and emissions/ fluxes, and to better understand processes, using data of controlled quality (and with less stringent time requirements (not needed in NRT)), and used in products such as Ozone and Greenhouse Gas Bulletins, and State/Health of the Atmosphere reports [source: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/documents/FINAL_GAW_221.pdf]"
climateApplications,,,Climate applications,"Fosters the effective application of climate knowledge and information for the benefit of society and the provision of climate services, including the prediction of significant climate variations both natural and as a result of human activity. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-Climate- CCl.pdf"
climateMonitoring,,,"Climate monitoring (as supported through the Global Climate Observing System, GCOS)","GCOS, an internationally coordinated network of global observing systems for climate, is designed to meet the requirements for climate observations, which are essential to climate monitoring. Climate observations are fundamental to detect, model and assess climate change, support adaptation to climate change, monitor the effectiveness of policies for mitigating climate change, develop climate information services, promote sustainable national economic development and meet other requirements of the UNFCCC and other convention and agreements."
cryosphere,,,Cryosphere,EGOS-IP
energy,,,Energy sector,"Economic activities that produce or distribute energy, such as renewable energies, e.g. solar, thermal, wind"
globalNumericalWeatherPrediction,,,Global numerical weather prediction (GNWP),"Global numerical weather prediction (GNWP) covers numerical weather prediction on a global scale, required for weather forecasting for more than a few days ahead. NWP uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current conditions of the atmosphere and oceans. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-Global-NWP.pdf"
health,,,Health sector,"Health-related services, often provided to the public, particularly those related to prevention, e.g. pollen allergies, UV radiation, heat wave alerts"
highResolutionNumericalWeatherPrediction,,,High-resolution numerical weather prediction (HRNWP),"High-resolution numerical weather prediction (HRNWP) covers forecasting of meteorological events over a limited area with a 1-5 km horizontal resolution, for 1 or 2 days ahead. Its high spatial resolutions allows: (i) to get more realistic descriptions of the surface and of atmospheric phenomena such as clouds and precipitation or boundary layer processes; and (ii) to use denser and more frequent observations than global NWP over the area of interest. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-HighRes-NWP.pdf"
hydrology,,,Hydrology,"Hydrology covers the assessment of the quantity and quality of water resources, both surface and groundwater (in support of the National Authorities responsible for water management in a wide range of activities), in order to meet the needs of society, to permit mitigation of water-related hazards, and to maintain or enhance the condition of the global environment. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SOG-Hydrology.pdf"
integratedUrbanServices,,,Integrated urban services,"Applications that target limited areas (with horizontal resolution of a few km or smaller and stringent timeliness requirements to support services related to weather/climate/pollution, such as air quality forecasting  [source: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/documents/FINAL_GAW_221.pdf]")
nowcasting,,,Nowcasting and very short-range forecasting (NVSRF),"Nowcasting and very short-range forecasting (NVSRF) covers the 0-12 hours forecasting range with high time and space resolution, focusing on rapid evolving phenomena like convection and using dedicated algorithms with combined relevant observed and model data, to produce forecasts usually near the surface, in a seamless way for the forecast range. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-Nowcasting-VSRF.pdf"
oceanApplications,,,Ocean applications,http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-Ocean.pdf
spaceWeather,,,Space weather,"Space weather is a discipline which aims at observing, understanding and predicting the state of the Sun, of the interplanetary and planetary environments, their disturbances, and the potential impacts of these disturbances on biological and technological systems. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-SW.pdf"
seasonalForecasting,,,Sub-seasonal to longer predictions,"Sub-seasonal to longer predictions covers predictions in sub-seasonal to decadal time-ranges (roughly two weeks to 10 years), using numerical prediction models based on current and past observations and analyses. http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/SOG/SoG-SSLP.pdf"
terrestrialEcology,,,Terrestrial ecology,"Activities and services related to the terrestrial environment, e.g., relating to bio-diversity"
transport,,,Transportation sector,"Economic activities related to transportation of people and goods, on land, air and water"
