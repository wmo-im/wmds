2,Atmospheric Applications,2.2 High-Resolution Numerical Weather Prediction,"High-resolution (HR) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) focuses on observing systems required by high-resolution NWP models producing forecasts of meteorological events with a 1-5 km horizontal resolution, 6 hours to a few days ahead. Such forecasts are more detailed than those available from global models, due to more realistic descriptions of atmospheric phenomena such as clouds and precipitation. The added detail is made possible by a finer computational grid on a specific area, more detailed specification of terrain, more sophisticated prescription of physical processes mainly based on explicit rather than parameterised formulations, and, importantly, denser and more frequent observations (with respect to global NWP) to specify appropriately detailed initial conditions."
3,Atmospheric Applications,2.3 Nowcasting / Very Short-Range Forecasting,"Nowcasting, as outlined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), involves detailed forecasting of local weather, utilizing any method to predict conditions from the present to six hours ahead. It provides a comprehensive portrayal of the current weather, leveraging real-time observational data such as surface observations, satellite imagery, lightning, radar data, etc. Nowcasting by extrapolation excels in delivering high-resolution forecasts of weather phenomena for the immediate (2 hour) future. Advancements in data assimilation systems enable Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) to outperform nowcast extrapolation thereafter. The use of NWP with data assimilation forms the basis of Very Short Range Forecasting (VSRF) up to 12 hours. To ensure a seamless VSRF, crucial in high-impact weather situations, advanced centers blend both NWP and nowcasting. This integration plays a vital role in issuing timely warnings and aiding decision-makers across various sectors."

6,Atmospheric Applications,2.6 Atmospheric Composition Forecasting and Monitoring,"Applications related to evaluating and analysing temporal and spatial changes in atmospheric composition, at regional and global scale. They aim to support treaty monitoring, climatologies, and re-analyses, assessing trends in composition and emissions/fluxes, and to better understand processes, principally in the troposphere and stratosphere. The applications rely on the use of data of controlled quality with less stringent time requirements compared to the near-real-time requirements. These data are also used to derive products that are published in the WMO ozone and greenhouse gas bulletins and the state of the atmosphere reports (for example, Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion reports)."

21,Oceanic Applications,3.5 Marine Environmental Emergency Response,"Marine environmental emergency response (MEER) refers to the response of any immediate and imminent threat of harm to the marine environment. This response is highly time sensitive as marine pollutants drift and disperse in the surrounding fluid and, thus, increasing the extent of the potential environmental harm. The time sensitivity of the data required to monitor and predict the transport of pollutants is of the utmost importance to mitigate damage to the marine environment."
