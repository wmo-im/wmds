2-01-2-1,Global Numerical Weather Prediction and Real-time Monitoring,Global Numerical Weather Prediction
2-01-2-2,High-Resolution Numerical Weather Prediction,"High-resolution (HR) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) focuses on observing systems required by high-resolution NWP models producing forecasts of meteorological events with a 1-5 km horizontal resolution, 6 hours to a few days ahead. Such forecasts are more detailed than those available from global models, due to more realistic descriptions of atmospheric phenomena such as clouds and precipitation. The added detail is made possible by a finer computational grid on a specific area, more detailed specification of terrain, more sophisticated prescription of physical processes mainly based on explicit rather than parameterised formulations, and, importantly, denser and more frequent observations (with respect to global NWP) to specify appropriately detailed initial conditions."
2-01-2-3,Nowcasting / Very Short-Range Forecasting,"Nowcasting, as outlined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), involves detailed forecasting of local weather, utilizing any method to predict conditions from the present to six hours ahead. It provides a comprehensive portrayal of the current weather, leveraging real-time observational data such as surface observations, satellite imagery, lightning, radar data, etc. Nowcasting by extrapolation excels in delivering high-resolution forecasts of weather phenomena for the immediate (2 hour) future. Advancements in data assimilation systems enable Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) to outperform nowcast extrapolation thereafter. The use of NWP with data assimilation forms the basis of Very Short Range Forecasting (VSRF) up to 12 hours. To ensure a seamless VSRF, crucial in high-impact weather situations, advanced centers blend both NWP and nowcasting. This integration plays a vital role in issuing timely warnings and aiding decision-makers across various sectors."
2-01-2-4,Sub-Seasonal to Longer Predictions,"Sub-seasonal to longer predictions (SSLP) covers predictions in sub-seasonal to decadal time-ranges (roughly two weeks to 10 years), using numerical prediction models based on current and past observations and analyses."
2-01-2-5,Atmospheric Climate Monitoring,"This AA covers the set of atmospheric observations defined by Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as essential to detect, model and assess climate change and its impact; support adaptation to climate change; monitor the effectiveness of policies for mitigating climate change; and develop climate information services."
2-01-2-6,Atmospheric Composition Forecasting and Monitoring,"Applications related to evaluating and analysing temporal and spatial changes in atmospheric composition, at regional and global scale. They aim to support treaty monitoring, climatologies, and re-analyses, assessing trends in composition and emissions/fluxes, and to better understand processes, principally in the troposphere and stratosphere. The applications rely on the use of data of controlled quality with less stringent time requirements compared to the near-real-time requirements. These data are also used to derive products that are published in the WMO ozone and greenhouse gas bulletins and the state of the atmosphere reports (for example, Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion reports)."
2-01-2-7,Atmospheric Composition Information Services in Urban and Populated Areas,"Applications that target limited areas (with horizontal resolution of a few km or smaller and stringent timeliness requirements to support services related to weather/climate/pollution, such as air quality forecasting."
2-01-2-8,Aeronautical Meteorology,"Application of meteorological information to aviation taking into account relevant developments in science and technology and the study of aeronautical meteorological requirements in support of the safety, regularity, efficiency and environmental sustainability of aviation with users ranging from pilots, air traffic control and management to airline dispatch offices as well as airport authorities."
2-01-2-9,Agricultural Meteorology,Applications of meteorology to agriculture (agrometeorology).
2-01-3-1,Ocean Forecasting and Real-Time Monitoring,"This application covers the set of observations that provide essential information to support monitoring ocean state in near-real-time and ocean forecasting systems on global, basin, and regional scales. These observations are also vital for ocean modeling development and for the verification of numerical weather predictions from medium-range to seasonal forecasts."
2-01-3-2,Coastal Forecasting,"Coastal Forecasting encompasses the collection of observations that contribute to oceanographic forecasting systems spanning from the nearshore areas and estuarine entrances to the continental shelf and slope. These forecasting systems serve various purposes, such as issuing alerts for storm surges and coastal inundation, providing vital information for coastal and offshore industries, and supporting recreational activities in the coastal areas. Note: Coastal forecasts supporting maritime safety are included in AA3.6 Maritime Safety. Coastal flooding related to tsunamis are considered in AA 3.4."
2-01-3-3,Oceanic Climate Monitoring and Services,"Oceanic Climate Monitoring covers the set of observations defined by the Global Climate Observing System as essential to detect, model and assess climate change and its impact; support adaptation to climate change; monitor the effectiveness of policies for mitigating climate change; and develop climate information services"
2-01-3-4,Tsunami Monitoring and Detection,"Tsunami Monitoring and Detection refers to the systematic processes to detect and forecast tsunamis, assess their potential threat to the coasts, marinas and harbours and issue timely tsunami advisory information to the stakeholders. Data related to tsunamis are acquired with both high frequency and high precision. The essential elements for early detection include the real-time transmission of seismic data, sea-level observations, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) measurements, which together provide a critical foundation for the effective monitoring and early warning against tsunami threats."
2-01-3-5,Marine Environmental Emergency Response,"Marine environmental emergency response (MEER) refers to the response of any immediate and imminent threat of harm to the marine environment. This response is highly time sensitive as marine pollutants drift and disperse in the surrounding fluid and, thus, increasing the extent of the potential environmental harm. The time sensitivity of the data required to monitor and predict the transport of pollutants is of the utmost importance to mitigate damage to the marine environment."
2-01-3-6,Maritime Safety (ports to open ocean),It covers the sets of observations to provide the services and warnings for the protection of life and property on all ships on all voyages at sea and in all [port] waters connected therewith.
