6,\Earth,,,Crustal motion (horizontal and vertical),"Changes in time of the position and height of the Earth plates. Indicative of the lithosphere dynamics, thus useful for earthquake prediction."
7,\Earth,,,Crustal plates positioning,Basis for monitoring the evolution of the lithosphere dynamics.
8,\Earth,,,Earth Rotation,"Rotation velocity of the Earth, determining the length of the day."
9,\Earth,,,Geoid,"Equipotential surface which would coincide exactly with the mean ocean surface of the Earth, if the oceans were in equilibrium, at rest, and extended through the continents (such as with very narrow channels)."
10,\Earth,,,Geomagnetic field,"Magnitude and direction of the 3D magnetic field on the surface of Earth and within the magnetosphere (i.e., in low-Earth orbit and in geosynchronous orbit)."
11,\Earth,,,Gravity field,Indicative of the statics and dynamics of the lithosphere and the mantle - Physical unit: [ mGal ] where : 1 Gal = 0.01 m s-2.
12,\Earth,,,Gravity gradients,"Gradient of the Earth's gravity field measured at the satellite orbital height - Physical unit: [ E ], Eötvös (1 E = 1 mGal / 10 km) - Accuracy unit: [ E ]."
