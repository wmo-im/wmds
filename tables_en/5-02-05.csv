The instrument uses an acoustic doppler transducer to measure water velocity, depth and vessel path simultaneously to compute discharge. As the instrument processes the signal reflected off the particles in the water, it divides the water column into a number of discrete segments stacked in the vertical (i.e. depth cells) and determines the velocity and direction of each segment, while the signal from the bottom (i.e. bottom-track) measures the speed and direction of the boat. Once the profile is finished the instrument calculates the total discharge and the operation is repeated a number of times, to give the river discharge estimate as the average value.

369,"hydrological, velocity, in situ",Acoustic doppler current meter,"Determination of stream velocity by means of an acoustic Doppler instrument, which measures the velocity of the water using the Doppler shift principle. The instrument transmits an acoustic pulse of energy into the water which is reflected off particles suspended in, and moving with, the water and some of it returns to the instrument. The instrument measures the Doppler shift (change in frequency) of the reflected energy and uses this to compute the velocity of the water relative to the instrument. The reflected pulses have a frequency (Doppler) shift proportional to the velocities of the scatterers they are travelling in along the acoustic beam: V = ( F_d / 2 F_0 ) C, where F_d is the Doppler shifted frequency received at the transducer, F_0 is the transducer transmit frequency, C is the sound speed, and V is the scatterer (water) velocity .
