A typical neutron probe contains a pellet of americium-241 and beryllium. The alpha particles emitted by the decay of the americium collide with the light beryllium nuclei, producing fast neutrons. When these fast neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei present in the soil being studied, they lose much of their energy. The detection of slow neutrons returning to the probe allows an estimate of the amount of hydrogen present. Since water contains two atoms of hydrogen per molecule, this therefore gives a measure of soil moisture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_probe, 2021)."

Therefore, the subsequent measurement is related to soil water tension. In the case of electrical resistance blocks, two electrodes are buried inside the block with a cable extending to the surface. The electrical resistance is measured between the two electrodes using a meter attached to the cable.

At the end of the measurement period, the evaporimeter is removed from the snow cover, the outside is wiped dry and a second measurement of weight is made. The difference between initial and final weights is converted to evaporation or condensation in centimetres. Measurements during periods of snowfall or blowing snow are not valid.

If the atmosphere remains saturated when in contact with the wet surface, then the latent-heat transfer (evaporation) may be expressed by: λE = ( ε / ( ε + 1 ))(Q* − G ), where Q* is the available net radiation, G is the soil-heat flux, and ε equals sλ/c_p , with s equal to the slope of the saturation specific humidity curve, λ is the latent heat of vaporization, and c_p is the specific heat of water. For equilibrium evaporation, it is proposed that: λE = α (ε / ( ε + 1 ))(Q* − G ), with α = 1.26, an empirical constant.

Computation of the stream discharge requires knowledge of the rate of injection (or total amount injected), the concentration of the tracer in the injected solution and the calibrated relationship between tracer concentration and the recorded property (for example, conductivity, colour and radioactivity) at the measuring site after it has been well mixed laterally. The site for measuring must be selected so that adequate mixing in a short length of channel is obtained. Many different tracer elements and detection equipment may be used. The computation of discharge is done by equations based on the principle of continuity of the tracer: Q = Q_tr c_i/c_s (continuous injection), Q = c_i V / ∫_0^∞ c_s d t (sudden injection) where Q_tr is the rate of injection, c_i is the concentration of injection solution, c_s is the concentration in the stream at the sampling section, V is the volume of injected solution and t is time (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."

The difference between the time of travel of the pulses crossing the river in an upstream direction and those travelling downstream is directly related to the average velocity of the water at the depth of the transducers. This velocity can be related to the average velocity of flow of the whole cross-section.

In an electromagnetic gauging station the coil is placed in the bed to generate a vertical magnetic field across the full channel width. Electrodes, set into opposite banks of the channel, sense the potential induced by the water flowing through the magnetic field. Control equipment drives en electric current through the coil and measures the induced potential which is proportional to the average velocity of the water.

The instrument uses an acoustic doppler transducer to measure water velocity, depth and vessel path simultaneously to compute discharge. As an ADCP instrument processes the signal reflected off the particles in the water, it divides the water column into a number of discrete segments stacked in the vertical. These segments are called depth cells. An ADCP instrument determines the velocity and direction of each depth cell. At the same time the signal from the bottom, called bottom-track, measures the speed and direction of the boat. Once the profile is finished the ADCP calculates the total discharge. At least four transects are recommended to calculate the discharge at a site. The actual river discharge estimate will then be the average of the N individual transects discharge values (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."
new id,"discharge, velocity, in situ",Acoustic doppler current meter,"An acoustic Doppler instrument measures the velocity of the water using a physical principle called the Doppler shift.

The instrument transmits an acoustic pulse of energy into the water which is reflected off particles suspended in, and moving with, the water and some of it returns to the instrument. The instrument measures the Doppler shift (change in frequency) of the reflected energy and uses this to compute the velocity of the water relative to the instrument. The reflected pulses have a frequency (Doppler) shift proportional to the velocities of the scatterers they are travelling in along the acoustic beam: V = ( F_d / 2 F_0 ) C, where F_d is the Doppler shifted frequency received at the transducer, F_0 is the transducer transmit frequency, C is the sound speed, and V is the scatterer (water) velocity (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."

new id,"groundwater, in situ",Capacitance sensor,"The key property of dielectric materials is the dielectric constant or relative permittivity. This property is the amount of charge the liquid can absorb. As the liquid is introduced near the electrodes of the capacitor, the capacitance changes progressively and liquid level can be determined. To measure variations in capacitance, electric energy flowing into and out of the electrodes is measured as the circuit potential is varied. A regular flow of energy is established by connecting the electrodes to an alternating current measurement circuit. The more energy flow to the electrodes, the greater the capacitance, meaning more liquid between the electrodes. This technique is frequently referred to as RF for the radio frequency signals applied to the capacitance circuit (https://www.levelsensorsolutions.com/capacitive-level-sensor, 2021 and WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."

new id,"groundwater, discharge",Orifice discharge measurement,"An orifice is an opening in a plate of specified diameter and beveled-edge confi guration that is fixed, usually by a flange, over the end of a horizontal discharge pipe (Figure I.6.8). The diameter of the orifice should be smaller than the diameter of the pipe. The water flowing through the discharge pipe is allowed to freely exit through the orifice. As the orifice somewhat restricts the flow, a back pressure results that is proportional to the flow. This pressure is measured, usually by direct measurement of a manometer tube, located about three pipe diameters upstream of the orifice and at the centre line of the pipe. The measured pressure value, the discharge pipe diameter and the orifice diameter are used to enter an “orifice table” to determine the flow. These tables and the specific requirements for the design of the discharge pipe and orifice can be found in ISO 5167-2 (2003) (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."

Several (normally three) observation wells are located at various radii from the pumped well. The pumping, of known discharge, causes a cone of depression in the aquifers potentiometric (piezometric) surface to form which results in a drawdown, which is the difference between the initial head, and the pumping head, h. Water-level data in each well including the pumping well are collected prior to the start of pumping to establish the pre-test static water level, and thereafter throughout the test. The pump discharge is also monitored (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."
