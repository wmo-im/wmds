187,hydrological;soil moisture;in situ,Electrical resistance blocks (Porous blocks),"Porous blocks are made of gypsum, glass/gypsum matrix, ceramic, nylon and fibreglass. They are buried at the depth of measurement desired. Over time, the blocks come to equilibrium with the moisture content in the surrounding soil. Therefore, the subsequent measurement is related to soil water tension. In the case of electrical resistance blocks, two electrodes are buried inside the block with a cable extending to the surface. The electrical resistance is measured between the two electrodes using a meter attached to the cable. Higher resistance readings mean lower block water content and higher soilwater tension (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008 4.5.3.2 https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10473)"

This relation is described by the following equation: Water level = (P_static – P_atm ) C, where P_static is the pressure in bar on a fixed spot in the water column, P_atm is the atmospheric pressure in bar on the surface of the water column, and C is a factor of the water’s net weight (C = 10.2 for freshwater at 20°C), which changes with the temperature and salinity of the water.

,hydrological;velocity;discharge;in situ,Acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP),"ADCP instruments can be mounted on a moving vessel, such as an inflatable boat. The instrument uses an acoustic doppler transducer to measure water velocity, depth and vessel path simultaneously to compute discharge. As an ADCP instrument processes the signal reflected off the particles in the water, it divides the water column into a number of discrete segments stacked in the vertical. These segments are called depth cells. An ADCP instrument determines the velocity and direction of each depth cell. At the same time the signal from the bottom, called bottom-track, measures the speed and direction of the boat. Once the profile is finished the ADCP calculates the total discharge. At least four transects are recommended to calculate the discharge at a site. The actual river discharge estimate will then be the average of the N individual transects discharge values (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008 5.3.7.5.3 https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10473)"
,hydrological;velocity;in situ,Acoustic doppler current meter,"An acoustic Doppler instrument measures the velocity of the water using a physical principle called the Doppler shift. This states that if a source of sound is moving relative to the receiver, the frequency of the sound at the receiver is shifted from the transmit frequency. The instrument transmits an acoustic pulse of energy into the water which is reflected off particles suspended in, and moving with, the water and some of it returns to the instrument. The instrument measures the Doppler shift (change in frequency) of the reflected energy and uses this to compute the velocity of the water relative to the instrument. The reflected pulses have a frequency (Doppler) shift proportional to the velocities of the scatterers they are travelling in along the acoustic beam: V = ( F_d / 2 F_0 ) C, where F_d is the Doppler shifted frequency received at the transducer, F_0 is the transducer transmit frequency, C is the sound speed, and V is the scatterer (water) velocity .

The decrease of intensity measured by a photoelectric or nuclear detector situated at constant distance from the source is proportional to the sediment concentration, if other relevant characteristics of water and sediment (chemical, mineral composition, etc.) remain unchanged.

,hydrological;sediment;ex situ,Displacement method,"The displacement method involves determining the difference in weight between a sample of sediment-laden water and an equal volume of clear water. The dry weight of sediment is computed by the following equation: W_s = k (W_ws - W_w), where k = q_s/(q-q_s), in which W_s is the weight of sediment to be determined in grams; W_ws is the weight of the specific gravity flask plus the weight of sediment water mixture in grams; W_w is the weight of the specific gravity flask plus the weight of clear water with volume and temperature equal to that of the sediment-water mixture; during weighing the water temperature should be constant; q_s is density of sediment particles; q is density of water; during weighing the water temperature should be constant (WMO Manual on Sediment Management and Measurement https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=1709)"
,hydrological;sediment;equation,Water discharge-sediment discharge rating curve,"A continuous record of suspended-sediment discharge is computed from a record of stream discharges and systematic samples of suspended-sediment concentration.
