12248,"particle phase, optical properties",,,Attenuated backscatter,The product of the total volume backscatter coefficient and the atmospheric two-way transmission of the layers between the instrument and the observed volume. The total volume backscatter coefficient is the sum of all backscatter coefficients from the atmosphere (including from molecules and particles) accounting for all polarizations. The atmospheric two-way transmission accounts for the total volume (molecular and particulate and all polarizations) extinction along the path from the instrument to the observed volume and back.
12249,"atmosphere,humidity",,,Relative humidity (with respect to water),The ratio of the amount fraction of the water vapour in the air to the corresponding amount fraction if the air were saturated with respect to water at a particular pressure and temperature. Relative humidity is typically reported in percent (%). [Based on definition of R1490 in International Vocabulary of Meteorology (WMO-No. 182). 1992.]
12250,"atmosphere,humidity",,,Specific humidity,"The ratio of the mass of water vapour in the air to the mass of a moist air parcel, where the mass of the moist air parcel is the sum of the mass of water vapour and the dry air. Synonym: Moisture content. [Based on definition of M1750 in International Vocabulary of Meteorology (WMO-No. 182). 1992.]"
12251,"particle phase, optical properties, atmosphere",,,Relative attenuated backscatter,"The product of the total volume backscatter coefficient and the atmospheric two-way transmission of the layers between the instrument and the observed volume presented in arbitrary units. The total volume backscatter coefficient is the sum of all backscatter coefficients from the atmosphere (including from molecules and particles) accounting for all polarizations. The atmospheric two-way transmission accounts for the total volume (molecular and particulate and all polarizations) extinction along the path from the instrument to the observed volume and back. The value of this variable in presented in relative, arbitrary units to account for observations of attenuated backscatter lacking final absolute calibrations."
12295,"atmosphere, remote sensing, level 1, optical properties",,,Radiance,"The radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a given surface, per unit solid angle per unit projected area. It is a directional quantity. Note: Historically, radiance was called 'intensity'."
12296,"atmosphere, remote sensing, level 1, optical properties",,,Spectral radiance,"The radiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. It is a directional quantity. Note: 'spectral radiance' is also used for measurements by radiometers and spectrometers, where it means the spectral radiance incident on the instrument integrated over the normalised spectral response function of the instrument. Historically, spectral radiance was called spectral intensity."
12297,"atmosphere, remote sensing, level 1, optical properties",,,Brightness temperature,Also called radiance temperature or equivalent black body temperature. The temperature of a black body emitting the spectral radiance equivalent to the observed spectral radiance at the observed frequency or wavelength.
12298,"atmosphere, remote sensing, level 1, optical properties",,,Spectral bidirectional reflectance,"Ratio of reflected to incident radiation as a function of incident angle, reflected angle and wavelength. For a satellite measurement, these angles are the zenith and azimuth angles of the sun and the zenith and azimuth angle of the viewing instrument at the feature (surface and/or atmospheric column) being observed."
