07/06/2002	raw			Raw	"CEOS: Physical information: Data in their original packets, as received from a satellite"
07/06/2003	level0			Level 0	"CIMO: Analogue/digital electric signals. CEOS: Physical information: Reconstructed unprocessed instrument data at full space time resolution with all available supplemental information to be used in subsequent processing (e.g. ephemeris, health and safety) appended."
07/06/2004	level1			Level I	"CIMO: Level I data (Primary Data): in general, are instrument readings expressed in appropriate physical units, and referred to Earth geographical coordinates. They require conversion to the normal meteorological variables (identified in Part I, Chapter 1). Level I data themselves are in many cases obtained from the processing of electrical signals such as voltages, referred to as raw data. Examples of these data are satellite radiances and water-vapour pressure, positions of constant-level balloons, etc. but not raw telemetry signals. Level I data still require conversion to the meteorological parameters specified in the data requirements. CEOS: Physical information: Unpacked, reformatted level 0 data, with all supplemental information to be used in subsequent processing appended. Optional radiometric and geometric correction applied to produce parameters in physical units. Data generally presented as full time/space resolution. A wide variety of sub level products are possible."
07/06/2005	level2			Level II	"CIMO: Level II data (Meteorological parameters). They may be obtained directly from many kinds of simple instruments, or derived from Level I data. For example, a sensor cannot measure visibility, which is a Level II quantity; instead, sensors measure the extinction coefficient, which is a Level I quantity. NOTE: Data exchanged internationally are Level II or Level III data. CEOS: Geophysical information. Retrieved environmental variables (e.g., ocean wave height, soil moisture, ice concentration) at the same resolution and location as the level 1 source data."
07/06/2006	level3			Level III	"CIMO: Level III (Initial state parameters) are internally consistent datasets, generally in grid-point form obtained from Level II data by applying established initialization procedures. NOTE: Data exchanged internationally are Level II or Level III data. CEOS: Geophysical information. Data or retrieved environmental variables which have been spatially and/or temporally re-sampled (i.e., derived from level 1 or 2 products). Such re-sampling may include averaging and compositing."
07/06/2007	level4			Level IV	"CEOS: Thematic information. Model output or results from analyses of lower level data (i.e., variables that are not directly measured by the instruments, but are derived from these measurements)."
