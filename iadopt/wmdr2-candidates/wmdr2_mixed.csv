"'An ensemble mean size of cloud hydrometeors derived from size distribution. Cloud hydrometeors refer to liquid and/or ice cloud particles. For liquid phase clouds, the effective radius is defined as the area weighted mean radius of liquid water drops, assimilated to spheres of the same volume. The effective radius of cloud ice particles has been defined in the literature in different ways. Clear and detailed definition should be provided as how this parameter is derived.'@en",Effective radius of cloud hydrometeors,'183',hydrometeors,effective radius,,true,true
'The direction of horizontal wind expressed in degrees at which the wind originates. This scalar quantity can be used to represent a value at a given location and an instantaneous time or average over spatio-temporal extent or values as a function of spatio-temporal coordinates. Note: 1) Wind direction is coded as 00 under \'Calm\' conditions at which the average wind speed is less than or equal to 0.2 m/s (< 1 kt). The direction in this case is coded as 00; 2) Wind direction at stations within 1 degree of the North Pole or 1 degree of the South Pole should be measured so that the azimuth ring should be aligned with its zero coinciding with the Greenwich 0 degree meridian.'@en,Horizontal wind direction at specified distance from reference surface,'12005',,wind direction,,true,true
